# Smart Timer

This project is made to run in the Sonoff POW hardware.

The softawe is based on [gmag11/FSBrowser](https://github.com/gmag11/FSBrowser) for the web configuration portal and [KmanOz/Sonoff-HomeAssistant](https://github.com/KmanOz/Sonoff-HomeAssistant) to get the power readings of the Sonoff POW.
